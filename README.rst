PWDGEN
======

PWDGEN is an example application. It is supposed to illustrate how to build a CLI using
the NIGHTHAWK module. This application assumes the following situation: A user has to think of
a password and cannot come up with one. This application however, solves the problem by generating
a number of key codes. This number of key codes is specified by the user. As and additional helper,
a TXT file is created, containing all the generated key codes. After using this application, the folder
in which the application was run should not contain a log file if PWDGEN has been run previously in the
same directory and the  directory has been cleared of the log file created by the user during that
previous session.
